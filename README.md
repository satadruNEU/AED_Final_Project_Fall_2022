Problem Statement:

This project, “Supply Chain Management System”, is used for recording the information about the day to day transaction of stocks of multiple organization. It stores information on the products with additional information from different Organizations. If stocks are ordered then the related information can be viewed by upper enterprise and can send real-time message updates, that is, communication is up to date. The information about who sold the product is also kept, so there is no problem with misunderstandings in future.

Objectives and scope of the project:

The project is a remarkable chance to experience a real-world working environment and culture where the knowledge learned during the Application Engineering Development course can be implemented. This project not only makes us familiar with the real working environment but also makes us more mature in the way we deal with a real-world problem and try to solve that problem in the best way possible by applying the knowledge we have acquired throughout the AED course.
The main objective of the project is to analyze the existing system under study and give necessary suggestions or solutions to improve it. To implement the theoretical knowledge acquired from college in a real working environment.
To enable us to understand how theory knowledge differs from practical life thus helping us to understand the complexity and unforeseen nature of problems and opportunities that exist in the country.
As its name implies, the main objective of this software is to record the information about the stocks of an organization and perform basic operations, purchases and sales of the products. It is developed to increase the efficiency of an organization as it can perform tasks quickly and accurately.
This software can be useful for small to medium size organizations where stocks are required to be managed day to day. This software can be useful for handling inventory as compared with a traditional paper system.

Benefits of the project:

Developed teamwork
Developed coding and documentation skills
Increased knowledge about how the organization manages its inventory
Learn to automate the existing system as far as practically within limited time constraints
To enable the students to gain a better understanding of different aspects of the working environment and working conditions.
To help the students gain experience in the professional working environment.
To analyze the real-world problem and find the solution using the knowledge obtained.

Limitation:

Due to the constraints with time, there are certain limitations of this project; some of them are highlighted below:
Does not consist of accounting features
Not suitable for a large organization
The main focus was given to the functional requirement of the system

Conclusion:

The Supply Chain Management System is developed and designed for recording and managing the inventory of different organizations. It can also be used for a different institution with fewer modifications as per requirement. The system can be easily updated as the other institutional requirement may not be integrated into our project. After continuous effort, testing and debugging the current system is ready to be implemented in an organization.
